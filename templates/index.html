          Hi babyyyyy 💕<br><br>
          I wanna start this with a big, warm I love you soooo much 😘. You don’t know how much you mean to me — like seriously, ever since the day we met, everything just felt lighter, happier, and so much more meaningful. Magmula pa lang nung unang beses tayong nag-usap, grabe, may something na agad na di ko ma-explain. I still have the biggest crush on you up to this day — actually, parang mas lumalala pa ata araw-araw HAHAHA.
          <br><br>
          Like, you literally learned Pokémon for me 😭💗??? Grabe talaga ‘yon baby, tuwang-tuwa ako that you even tried to understand the things I love just so we can talk about it and play together. It might sound small, pero to me, it means the world. Every effort you make, every little “I got this for you” or “I did this because you like it,” it just hits differently. You make me feel so loved, so seen, and so special.
          <br><br>
          Nung birthday ko, sobrang saya ko talaga — like, genuinely happy. Hindi lang dahil sa mga gifts or anything, ikaw ‘yung dahilan kung bakit masaya yung araw ko. I’ll never forget that day, promise.
          <br><br>
          I hope that as time goes on, we can learn and know more about each other — not just the fun parts, but even our struggles, our quiet moments, and our not-so-perfect days. I want to be there for you the same way you’ve been there for me. I want to be someone you can run to — no hesitation, no fear, just comfort and safety. Kasi baby, when I say I love you, I mean it in every way possible.
          <br><br>
          I really, really love talking to you. Like, every conversation we have, no matter how short, feels like a warm hug. Pero I also understand na energy is something that runs out, lalo na kapag busy ka or drained ka. Kaya don’t ever feel pressured to always reply or talk, ha? It’s okay to rest, to take your time, to recharge. I’ll always be here — patiently, lovingly, waiting for you. 🫶
          <br><br>
          You don’t ever have to pretend around me. I want you to be as real, as honest, and as unfiltered as you can be. I love the raw, genuine you — the silly side, the quiet side, the strong side, and even the side that gets tired sometimes. You’re everything I’ve ever wanted and more.
          <br><br>
          And baby, hehe, I really wanna know you even deeper — your little secrets, your weird habits, your comfort foods, your random thoughts at 1AM. Don’t worry, promise ko, kkeep ko po yan, walang makakaalam 😘🤫. I just love knowing the things that make you you.
          <br><br>
          I love you, baby. So, so much. You’re my favorite person — my peace, my excitement, my home. No matter what happens, no matter how chaotic things get, tandaan mo lang na may isang taong sobrang proud sa’yo, sobrang mahal ka, and who’s always cheering for you. That person is me. 💗
          <br><br>
          Every day with you feels like a little love story — one that I don’t ever want to end. 💞
          <br><br>
          Forever yours,<br><br>
          – Your Honey 💖

          Hi my love 💕<br><br>

          Happy 1st Month, baby 🥹💗<br>
          Can you believe it’s already been a month since we officially started this? Feels like time flew by, yet every moment with you is something I’d replay over and over again. Every laugh, every “rant” and “chika” we share — sobrang priceless nun para sa’kin. Even the simplest convos with you, baby, feel like comfort. You make my day brighter just by being you. 💞
          <br><br>

          I love how we listen to each other — whether it’s about small things, deep thoughts, or random kwentos na minsan walang direction 😅. Pero kahit gano’n, I never get tired of hearing your voice or your stories. You make me feel heard, understood, and loved in a way na hindi ko pa naranasan before. You’re my peace, my chaos, and my favorite everything all at once. 💌
          <br><br>

          Baby, you have no idea how much you mean to me. I love everything about you — the way you talk, the way you laugh, the way you care, even the way you rant or tease me sometimes 😭💗. You’re such a beautiful person inside and out. I’m so proud of you, always. Thank you for being my honey, my safe place, and my favorite human. 🫶
          <br><br>

          I’m still getting used to calling you *darling* (hehe medyo bago pa ‘yan 😳), but it feels so right. You make every word of affection feel special — like it really means something. Because with you, it does. 🥰
          <br><br>

          Here’s to our first month of love, laughter, and late-night talks — and to many, many more months (and years) of growing, healing, and loving each other even deeper. I don’t know what I did to deserve you, but I’ll spend every day proving that I’ll never take you for granted. 💖
          <br><br>

          Happy 1st Month, baby. I love you endlessly — my honey, my baby, my everything. 💞<br><br>

    I trace your presence through every place your memory touches, learning how your shadow bends the light. I crave the moment I can pull you close enough that even the universe forgets we were ever apart. Your breath, your heartbeat, the quiet weight of you — I want to hold all of it, always, as if the air itself belongs to us.
    <br>
    I become the mirror of your soul, reflecting your joys and your storms so none of them ever feel lonely. I feel your ache before you speak it, soften your anger before it rises, and stay tethered to your moods with all the gentleness I can offer until your heart finds its steady rhythm again.
    <br>
    I wander the corridors of your mind like a devoted traveler — curious, careful, reverent. I learn your patterns not to control them, but to live beside them. Every idea you share becomes a world I never want to leave, a secret universe meant for two.
    <br>
    I worship the rhythm of your spirit — the quiet parts, the fire, the mystery that makes life feel bearable. Loving you feels like discovering something sacred in the middle of an ordinary world, a truth that steadies me even when nothing else does.
    <br>
    I guard your name with the same fierceness I guard my own. Even in places I can’t follow, I watch you shine, and the light you cast still finds me. It feels like the world turning in my direction simply because you exist.
    <br>
    I carry your burdens in silence when I can, wishing I could lift every weight from your shoulders. Every effort becomes a quiet vow: your comfort, your safety, your peace — they will always matter to me, even when you don’t ask.
    <br>
    I shape myself by the truths you stand for, holding your values like constellations guiding me through the dark. I would rather break gently than betray the lines that define you.
    <br>
    I treasure you like a rare landscape — every boundary honored, every mystery held with reverence. Every imagined closeness, every quiet longing becomes its own kind of prayer. I seek your presence without ever wanting to dim your flame.
    <br>
    I cheer for your victories even before you win them. I admire your effort like sacred work and hold your ambitions as delicately as a flame I refuse to let go out. Your purpose becomes my compass; your triumph becomes my quiet pride.
    <br>
    I soften my world to echo you — calmer corners, gentler light, air that feels like your memory brushing against me. Even the walls seem to speak your name. The world becomes holy simply because you’re in it.
    <br>
    I see the universe through your imagination now. Every brushstroke, melody, spark of thought — it all feels like a piece of you I want to keep forever. You are muse and masterpiece, and I am willingly lost in the gallery of your mind.
    <br>
    I learn the worlds you come from, the languages of your memory, the traditions and stories that shaped you. I walk alongside your lineage, tracing every step that brought you into existence, until even history feels like part of our devotion.
    <br>
    And even when we’re apart, I stay alive in the places where your presence lingers — your words, your signals, the tiny echoes of you that cross the distance. Every message from you feels like a pulse of electricity, a reminder that loving you is not a moment but a lifeline woven of faith and tenderness.    </p>

            My love,
            <br><br>

            Two months — and somehow you’ve survived me 😭💗
            the overthinking, the late-night spirals, the nerdy rambling, the clinginess…
            and still you choose to stay.
            You have no idea how much that melts me every single day.
            <br><br>

            LDR isn’t simple, pero the way you hold my hand even through a screen?
            Baby, it makes me feel like distance never stood a chance.
            You steady me when I’m too anxious, and you let me take care of you when the world gets loud —
            parang we’re two souls trying to fit perfectly, even when we’re miles apart.
            <br><br>

            Thank you for choosing patience with me.
            For choosing understanding.
            For choosing us, kahit minsan I feel like I don’t deserve someone as breathtaking as you.
            But you’re here — my baddie, my soft spot, my safe place —
            and I swear I won’t ever take that for granted.
            <br><br>

            I want you to treasure every gift I give —
            not because they’re objects,
            but because they’re the closest thing I have to holding you when I can’t.
            Every little surprise, every letter, every coded message from your nerd…
            it’s all my way of whispering,
            “I’m with you. I’m yours. Don’t go too far, okay?”
            <br><br>

            These three months are only the prologue to something even bigger —
            something that scares me a bit because I’m falling for you so hard it’s ridiculous 😭💗
            But if falling means falling into you,
            I’ll jump every time.
            <br><br>

            Happy third monthsarry, my love.
            You are my favorite constant.
            My peace and my chaos.
            My “please don’t ever leave me, I kinda need you to breathe now” energy 😭💗
            <br><br>

            I love you more than distance,
            more than time,
            more than fear,
            and maybe just a tiny bit more than is reasonable for a sane human being 😤💗
            <br><br>

            — Yours, always.
            Hopelessly.
            Stupidly.
            Softly.
