          Hi babyyyyy 💕<br><br>
          I wanna start this with a big, warm I love you soooo much 😘. You don’t know how much you mean to me — like seriously, ever since the day we met, everything just felt lighter, happier, and so much more meaningful. Magmula pa lang nung unang beses tayong nag-usap, grabe, may something na agad na di ko ma-explain. I still have the biggest crush on you up to this day — actually, parang mas lumalala pa ata araw-araw HAHAHA.
          <br><br>
          Like, you literally learned Pokémon for me 😭💗??? Grabe talaga ‘yon baby, tuwang-tuwa ako that you even tried to understand the things I love just so we can talk about it and play together. It might sound small, pero to me, it means the world. Every effort you make, every little “I got this for you” or “I did this because you like it,” it just hits differently. You make me feel so loved, so seen, and so special.
          <br><br>
          Nung birthday ko, sobrang saya ko talaga — like, genuinely happy. Hindi lang dahil sa mga gifts or anything, ikaw ‘yung dahilan kung bakit masaya yung araw ko. I’ll never forget that day, promise.
          <br><br>
          I hope that as time goes on, we can learn and know more about each other — not just the fun parts, but even our struggles, our quiet moments, and our not-so-perfect days. I want to be there for you the same way you’ve been there for me. I want to be someone you can run to — no hesitation, no fear, just comfort and safety. Kasi baby, when I say I love you, I mean it in every way possible.
          <br><br>
          I really, really love talking to you. Like, every conversation we have, no matter how short, feels like a warm hug. Pero I also understand na energy is something that runs out, lalo na kapag busy ka or drained ka. Kaya don’t ever feel pressured to always reply or talk, ha? It’s okay to rest, to take your time, to recharge. I’ll always be here — patiently, lovingly, waiting for you. 🫶
          <br><br>
          You don’t ever have to pretend around me. I want you to be as real, as honest, and as unfiltered as you can be. I love the raw, genuine you — the silly side, the quiet side, the strong side, and even the side that gets tired sometimes. You’re everything I’ve ever wanted and more.
          <br><br>
          And baby, hehe, I really wanna know you even deeper — your little secrets, your weird habits, your comfort foods, your random thoughts at 1AM. Don’t worry, promise ko, kkeep ko po yan, walang makakaalam 😘🤫. I just love knowing the things that make you you.
          <br><br>
          I love you, baby. So, so much. You’re my favorite person — my peace, my excitement, my home. No matter what happens, no matter how chaotic things get, tandaan mo lang na may isang taong sobrang proud sa’yo, sobrang mahal ka, and who’s always cheering for you. That person is me. 💗
          <br><br>
          Every day with you feels like a little love story — one that I don’t ever want to end. 💞
          <br><br>
          Forever yours,<br><br>
          – Your Honey 💖

  Hi my love 💕<br><br>

  Happy 1st Month, baby 🥹💗<br>
  Can you believe it’s already been a month since we officially started this? Feels like time flew by, yet every moment with you is something I’d replay over and over again. Every laugh, every “rant” and “chika” we share — sobrang priceless nun para sa’kin. Even the simplest convos with you, baby, feel like comfort. You make my day brighter just by being you. 💞
  <br><br>

  I love how we listen to each other — whether it’s about small things, deep thoughts, or random kwentos na minsan walang direction 😅. Pero kahit gano’n, I never get tired of hearing your voice or your stories. You make me feel heard, understood, and loved in a way na hindi ko pa naranasan before. You’re my peace, my chaos, and my favorite everything all at once. 💌
  <br><br>

  Baby, you have no idea how much you mean to me. I love everything about you — the way you talk, the way you laugh, the way you care, even the way you rant or tease me sometimes 😭💗. You’re such a beautiful person inside and out. I’m so proud of you, always. Thank you for being my honey, my safe place, and my favorite human. 🫶
  <br><br>

  I’m still getting used to calling you *darling* (hehe medyo bago pa ‘yan 😳), but it feels so right. You make every word of affection feel special — like it really means something. Because with you, it does. 🥰
  <br><br>

  Here’s to our first month of love, laughter, and late-night talks — and to many, many more months (and years) of growing, healing, and loving each other even deeper. I don’t know what I did to deserve you, but I’ll spend every day proving that I’ll never take you for granted. 💖
  <br><br>

  Happy 1st Month, baby. I love you endlessly — my honey, my almost-darling, my everything. 💞<br><br>
  – Your Honey 💌
